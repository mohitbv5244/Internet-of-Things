components required:
1) Touch sensor
2) A buzzer
3) Intel Edison board

We have the main XDK file that contains Javascript files, where
the tocuh sensor values are read and displayed on the XDK platform
depending on the touch sensor values.
When the touch sensor is pressed, the buzzer is switched ON
and it is displayed on the XDK platform.

There is a mobile APP which is called touch sensor part,
when we enter the right IP address and the port number, depending on the
touch values, we can see the buzz is ON or not from an APP.
