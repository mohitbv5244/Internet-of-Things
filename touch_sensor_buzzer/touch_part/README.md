App Overview
------------

Demonstrates reading digital data from the touch sensor in a
[Grover Starter Kit Plus](https://www.seeedstudio.com/
Grove-Starter-Kit-Plus-IoT-Edison-p-2634.html) (or equivalent) I/O kit.
The app starts a web server on the IoT device that can then be used for
communication via a [WebSocket](https://www.websocket.org/) interface.

This IoT app works in conjunction with a mobile companion app also named
"Touch Notifier." The corresponding mobile app project can be found in the
"Samples and Demos" section of the "HTML5 Companion App" section of the "Start
a New Project" page (located on the Projects tab). See that app for additional
details.

Tested IoT Node.js Platforms
----------------------------

* [Intel速 Galileo Board for Arduino](http://intel.com/galileo)
* [Intel速 Edison Board for Arduino](http://intel.com/edison)

This sample can run on other IoT [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) development
platforms, that include the appropriate sensor hardware, but may require
changes to the I/O initialization and configuration code in order to work on
those other platforms.
