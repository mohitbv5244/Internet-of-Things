In this project, we have a LCD, a temperature sensor and the intel edison
development board.
The values that are read from the tempearture sensor
are displayed on the XDK platform and on the APP.
But, before we can see the values, we need to enter the port number 
and after the verfifcation, we can see the values displayed on the APP.
Please refer to the photos updated.
